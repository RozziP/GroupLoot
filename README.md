## Group Loot

Builds upon Solst1c3's shared loot mod in an attempt to make group play smooth and balanced.
* Any looted item is given to all living team members.
* 3D printers and cauldrons remove the same items from each team member.
* Interactable items (chests, shrines, printers, etc.) no longer scale with the number of team members.
* Boss drops no longer scale with the number of team members (i.e. bosses will only ever drop 1 item + 1 or 2 from shrines of the mountain)
### Install

### Changelog
1.1.1: Fixed an issue with spawning chests  
1.1.0: It actually works now. Removed group scaling from bosses.
